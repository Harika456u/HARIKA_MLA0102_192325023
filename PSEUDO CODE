BFS (Breadth-First Search) – Pseudocode:
BFS(Graph, startNode):
    create an empty Queue Q
    mark startNode as visited
    enqueue startNode into Q
    while Q is not empty:
        currentNode ← dequeue Q
        print currentNode
        for each adjacentNode of currentNode:
            if adjacentNode is not visited:
                mark adjacentNode as visited
                enqueue adjacentNode into Q

DFS (Depth-First Search) – Pseudocode:
DFS(Graph, startNode):
    mark startNode as visited
    print startNode

    for each adjacentNode of startNode:
        if adjacentNode is not visited:
            DFS(Graph, adjacentNode)
